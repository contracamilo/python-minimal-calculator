For this activity, we will develop a Python algorithm that allows us to create a calculator with the main functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, factorial) using all the basic concepts seen in the previous unit. Keep in mind that we will focus on the logic of the algorithm and not on the graphical part of the program.

As a "plus", you can add an unspecified operation to the calculator. This option is not obligatory, but it will give you an advantage in the final grade of the workshop if it works correctly. If so, talk to your teacher so that they take this additional value into account in the evaluation of this activity.

Format: Python
